# Potato Disease Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training an image classification model to detect potato diseases using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
- Implements image classification for potato disease detection
- Configurable image size, batch size, and epochs

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images with different diseases. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory before training. also available on kaggle

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook training.ipynb
   ```
